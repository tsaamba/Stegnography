Overview

This project presents a steganography technique designed to conceal secret messages within images. The implementation provides a secure and intuitive method for encrypting and decrypting messages using a password.

Key Features

- Image-Based Steganography: Conceals secret messages within images
- Password-Based Encryption: Ensures secure encryption and decryption using a password
- Basic Steganography Technique: Implements a fundamental steganography approach

System Requirements

- Python 3.x: Required programming language
- OpenCV Library (cv2): Essential for image processing

Encryption Process

1. Enter Image Path: Specify the image file
2. Enter Secret Message: Input the message to be concealed
3. Enter Password: Set a password for secure encryption

Decryption Process

1. Enter Encrypted Image Path: Specify the encrypted image file
2. Enter Password: Input the password for secure decryption
